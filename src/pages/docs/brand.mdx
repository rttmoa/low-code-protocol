## Trademark Usage Agreement

The Steedos name and logos are trademarks of Steedos Labs Inc.

You may not use the Steedos name or logos in any way that could mistakenly imply any official connection with or endorsement of Steedos Labs Inc. Any use of the Steedos name or logos in a manner that could cause customer confusion is not permitted.

This includes naming a product or service in a way that emphasizes the Steedos brand, like "Steedos Themes" or "Steedos Studio", as well as in domain names like "Steedoskits.com".

Instead, you must use your own brand name in a way that clearly distinguishes it from Steedos CSS.  Examples that are permitted include "ComponentStudio for Steedos CSS" or "UtilityThemes: Templates for Steedos CSS".

Additionally, you may not use our trademarks for t-shirts, stickers, or other merchandise without explicit written consent.
