Salesforce Flow provides two types of flows: screen flows and autolaunched flows.

To automate a business process that collects data from people, use a screen flow. For example, create a guided tutorial or wizard with screens.

To launch a flow internally when a record changes or when a user clicks a button, use an autolaunched flow. For example, add automation to your page or app to perform an action to a record when a user clicks a button.
