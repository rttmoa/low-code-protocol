With Process Builder, you can:

- Create a record of any object type
- Update any related record—not just the record or its parent
- Use a quick action to create a record, update a record, or log a call
- Invoke a process from another process
- Launch a flow—you can’t schedule this action with workflow
- Send an email
- Send a custom notification
- Post to Chatter
- Submit a record for approval
